# XHF-Reddit2txt

This Python3 script will allow the user to retrieve (or fetch) up to 1000 of a given Reddit username's comments from new, hot, or top. The user will provide input to a new or existing text file where the comments will be saved. If any retrieved comment already exists in the text file, it will not be added. 

Info:

1. Failsafes exist for invalid filename characters and all other inputs.

2. You can input your filename with or without a txt extension (e.g. data.txt). The script will add one for you if necessary.

3. Please contact me at xhfhope@gmail.com with ideas, comments, and possible improvements.
