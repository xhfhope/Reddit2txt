# XHF-Reddit2txt
Input username and this py3 script will fetch a user's 1000 previous Reddit posts in new, hot, and top, and then output the comments into a text file.

Info:
1. Failsafes exist for invalid usernames.
2. You can include '.txt' when inputting a desired filename, but you don't have to. 
3. If a filename already exists, the script will scan that file for a comment before outputting a fetched (or retrieved) comment.
