# XHF-Reddit2txt

This Python3 script will retrieve (or fetch) a user's Reddit posts in new, hot, or top. The user can then choose a text file to output the comments to. If any comment already exists in the text file, it will not be added. 

Info:

1. Failsafes exist for invalid inputs.

2. You can input your filename with or without its file extension (e.g. data.txt). The edited file will always have a .txt extension.

3. Please contact me at xhfhope@gmail.com with ideas, comments, and possible improvements.
